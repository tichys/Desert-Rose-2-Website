This does not always mean realistic, however you should uphold the suspension of disbelief on the server. You should be able to speak in full sentences that are coherent. It is strongly suggested to correct your typos. Referencing OOC terms in IC is not allowed.</p>

      <p>A: Go for it. If you gather materials, and pray that you are making something from them, you are more likely to get objects you ask for (clothes, objects made of wood, certain machinery or weapons, etc). If you give a Skill Check style prayer to evaluate, bonus points for good RP.</p>
