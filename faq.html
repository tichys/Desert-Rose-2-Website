      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </div>

      <h3>Q:What is this server?</h3>
      <p>A: Desert Rose is a High Roleplay SS13 server based around Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 1 & 2. Knowing the lore is required for roles like NCR and Legion, however it is possible to play an ignorant dirt farmer or tribal who knows nothing and is just trying to survive in a hostile wasteland. The codebase is TG, and while there are "lewd verbs" they are off by default in character creation and must be enabled. The rules heavily favor Capture based gameplay, there are no valids. The atmosphere is intended to be chill and relaxed, with a focus on Settlement RP.</p>
      <br><hr>
      <h3>What is the setting?</h3>
      <p>A: While this is subject to change, the map's story takes place shortly before the events of New Vegas. The location is Yuma, AZ - directly between Legion and NCR territory. The local settlement has remained independent and hidden - until now, as the two factions fight for control. A secret bunker and a hidden vault have also begun to send scouts into the ruins of the town.</p>
	  <br><hr>
	  <h3>What is the Standard of roleplay?</h3>
	  <p>A: Generally it is required to behave as a believable character in the Fallout universe. This does not always mean realistic, however you should uphold the suspension of disbelief on the server. You should be able to speak in full sentences that are coherent. It is strongly suggested to correct your typos. Referencing OOC terms in IC is not allowed.</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: Am I allowed to do anything to SSD's?</h3>
      <p>A: Yes, you are allowed to tuck them into bed and use the interact menu on them to pat their head. Stealing from an SSD player is in bad faith, because as rounds on the server are very long, people who log back on later should have a moderate expectation of their body remaining viable. (In the future there may be a mechanical system implemented to protect this. For now, it's the honor system.)</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: How do I use the interact menu?</h3>
      <p>A: Drag yourself onto your target.</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: What should I do if someone asks me not to do something in LOOC?</h3>
      <p>A: Don't do it.</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: Can I say the N word?</h3>
      <p>A: No</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: Can I respawn as the same character?</h3>
      <p>A: Only if you matrix out: go to a matrix tile and drag yourself onto it.</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: Can I ahelp for...</h3>
      <p>A: Go for it. If you gather materials, and pray that you are making something from them, you are more likely to get objects you ask for (clothes, objects made of wood, certain machinery or weapons, etc). If you give a Skill Check style prayer to evaluate, bonus points for good RP.</p>
    <br><hr>
      <h3>Q: Is EORG allowed?</h3>
      <p>A: Based on a recent vote, no.</p>
